This is a repositiory for my work generating arithmetic problems. My goal is to include arbitrary examples of the four basic arithmetic operations.

For division, I chose to restrict the dividends and divisors to produce answers suitable to more students.

To get practice problems and corresponding answer key, run these scripts in Python3.
